<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is one of India's most famous historical monuments. 
Located in Old Delhi, this massive red sandstone fort was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648. 
It served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of India's independence.

<h2>History of Red Fort</h2>
<p>
The construction of Red Fort began in 1638 when Shah Jahan decided to shift his capital 
from Agra to Delhi. The fort complex includes palaces, audience halls, gardens, and mosques. 
After the Mughal era, the fort was used by the British army. On 15 August 1947, India’s first Prime Minister hoisted the national flag here, 
a tradition that continues every Independence Day.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>
The Red Fort is built using red sandstone, which gives it its name. The fort features impressive gates such as Lahori Gate and Delhi Gate. 
Inside the complex are Diwan-i-Aam, Diwan-i-Khas, Rang Mahal, and beautiful Mughal gardens. 
The blend of Persian, Timurid, and Indian architectural styles makes it a masterpiece of Mughal design.
