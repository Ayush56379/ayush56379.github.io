<h2>History of Nahargarh Fort</h2>

Nahargarh Fort was built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur. 
Originally named Sudarshangarh, it was later renamed Nahargarh, meaning “Abode of Tigers.”

According to local legend, the spirit of a prince named Nahar Singh Bhomia haunted the construction site. 
To appease him, a temple was built within the fort premises.
